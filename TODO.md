# TODO: Adjust Login Page Layout for Smaller Sides at 768px+

## Steps:
1. [x] Add custom CSS classes in `globals.css` for narrower left and right sides (25% and 75% width) starting from 768px.
2. [x] Update `src/app/login/page.js` to apply the custom classes instead of Tailwind's `md:w-2/5` and `md:w-3/5`.
3. Test the layout by running the development server and checking responsiveness.
